  While planning my trip across the Pacific north-west, I had been told enough about Seattle and Portland from colleagues to form a basic understanding of what would await me in the United States. "You can't skip out on Powell's city of books in Portland", "Throw a shoe at Jeff Bezos in Seattle", and "Come home with a pound of coffee from Dubsea" various patrons would tell me. Whenever I'd inquire about Vancouver though, I'd receive blank stares. Not a single friend or family member could offer me the slightest advice on what to do while in Canada's most westward city, so I naturally decided to visit Vancouver without a single plan or preconception. At customs, where I arrived with a hammock in one hand and a passport in the other, I was questioned regarding my itinerary for this trip. I simply shook my hammock in the air and smiled. This proved to be my first (of many) mistakes on this trip. The officer, who failed to display any appreciation for the humor of my situation, decided that my very first hour in Canada would be spent in a dark interrogation room. After around 60 questions spanning from my childhood upbringing to my lack of a driver's license, I was released through a corridor that let out at a Tim Hortons. I should have known right then and there that I'd fall in love with this beautiful city!

<p>The neighborhood was simply beautiful. Every house on the block has a raised garden with their very own compost box. The people here are kind, environmentally conscious, and incredibly helpful. There’s also no shortage of great food, coffee, and art in Vancouver. Speaking of which…</p>

<h1 id="Every-successful-day-starts-with-coffee-☕"><a href="#Every-successful-day-starts-with-coffee-☕" class="headerlink" title="Every successful day starts with coffee. ☕"></a>Every successful day starts with coffee. ☕</h1><p>Right across the street from my Airbnb was Vancouver’s third-best coffee shop according to vancouvercoffeesnob.com. If you ask me though, it was easily my number one spot. They even had a Vegan+Gluten Free blueberry chai muffin. 🤤 I downed it before heading to our first stop, recommended by our host, Granville island!</p>

<h1 id="Snacks-Sights-amp-souvenirs"><a href="#Snacks-Sights-amp-souvenirs" class="headerlink" title="Snacks, Sights, &amp; souvenirs"></a>Snacks, Sights, &amp; souvenirs</h1><p>Granville Island was absolutely stunning. It was a beautiful vantage point for the city and a great place to find some souvenirs. For lunch, I had some cauliflower tacos and for dessert, I had a maple syrup stick. There’s a lot to do here,  a lot to see here, and a lot to eat here. What a beautiful start to Vancouver! Next up we decided to head downtown for some drinks and adventure before calling it a night.<br><span class="half-img"><img src="17.jpg" alt=""> <img src="18.jpg" alt=""></span><br><img src="24.jpg" alt=""><br><span class="half-img"><img src="22.jpg" alt=""> <img src="23.jpg" alt=""></span><br><img src="25.jpg" alt=""><br><span class="half-img"><img src="26.jpg" alt=""> <img src="27.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
